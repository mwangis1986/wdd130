    <h2>Samuel Mwangi</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is samuel Mwangi from kenya. I am married and blessed with two children. I would realy love to be a web developer
       <br> I am happy because of the opportunity given by BYU, and I believe at the end of this course I will have made new friends.</p>
        <p>I am not a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day. I love the way they conduct themselves though.</p>
        <p>Currently I am a trainee in graphic design. I really love interacting with new friends, I know this will be a great class and I can't wait meeting you all.</p>
        <p>Thank you</p>
